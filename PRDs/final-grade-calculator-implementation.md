# Final-Grade Calculator Implementation Brief

## Overview

The Final-Grade Calculator allows students to determine their overall course grade based on the weights and scores of individual grade components (like homework, midterms, participation). It helps students understand their current standing and explore "what-if" scenarios by adjusting component scores.

## Core Functionality

- Input multiple grade components (e.g., Homework, Labs, Midterm 1, Final Exam, Participation)
- For each component:
    - Specify the weight (percentage of the total grade)
    - Specify the score earned (e.g., 85 out of 100, or 85%)
- Calculate and display the overall final course grade based on the entered components, weights, and scores.
- Allow users to easily modify scores to see how changes impact the overall grade ("what-if" scenarios).

## Viral/Shareable Features

- Implement a "Share My Grade" feature allowing students to share their calculated overall grade (or potential scenarios) via social media with customizable, visually appealing cards (perhaps obscuring specific component scores for privacy if desired).
- Create subtle animations or visual feedback when the calculated grade changes.

## UI/UX Approach

- Maintain the clean, distraction-free interface established in other calculators.
- Use the existing ShadCN UI component library for consistency.
- Implement responsive design that works well on mobile devices.
- Provide clear visual feedback on the calculated overall grade.
- Allow dynamic addition and removal of grade components.

## Implementation Requirements

### Page Structure

1. Header with page title ("Final Grade Calculator") and brief explanation.
2. Calculator card area for adding/managing grade components.
    - Input fields for Component Name, Weight (%), and Score (%).
    - Buttons to add more components or remove existing ones.
3. Results display showing the calculated overall course grade prominently.
4. Optional: A visual breakdown (e.g., a pie or bar chart) showing how each component contributes to the final grade.

### Technical Considerations

- Implement using the existing React component patterns.
- Manage the state of multiple components (name, weight, score) effectively, potentially using `useState` with an array of objects or a more complex state management solution if needed.
- Ensure proper form validation (e.g., weights sum to 100%, scores are valid percentages).
- Handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., weights not summing correctly).

### Integration Points

- Use the existing CalculationContext pattern if applicable for sharing state or common calculation logic, or establish a new context if more appropriate.
- Follow the established route structure.

## Essence of Simplicity

- Primary focus on the intuitive input of grade components and the clear display of the overall grade.
- Every UI element should directly support the calculation process.
- Adding/removing/editing components should be straightforward.
- The "what-if" aspect should be implicitly supported by allowing easy score modification.

### Non-goals:

- No need to allow users to save calculations.
- Does not need to predict future grades based on incomplete data (focus is on calculating based on *earned* scores, though users can input hypothetical scores for "what-if").

## SEO Implementation

- Implement the following JSON-LD structured data for rich search results:
