# Semester GPA Calculator Implementation Brief

## Overview

The Semester GPA Calculator allows students to determine their Grade Point Average (GPA) for a single academic semester based on the grades earned and credit hours for each course taken during that term. It helps students track their term-specific academic performance and explore "what-if" scenarios by adjusting course grades.

## Core Functionality

- Input multiple courses taken within a single semester.
- For each course:
    - Specify the course name (optional, for user reference).
    - Specify the grade earned (e.g., A, B+, C, 3.7, 85%, etc. - need a flexible input/mapping).
    - Specify the number of credit hours for the course.
- Calculate and display the overall semester GPA based on the entered courses, grades, and credit hours.
- Allow users to easily modify grades or credit hours to see how changes impact the semester GPA ("what-if" scenarios).
- Define a clear mapping from various grade formats (letter, percentage) to GPA points (e.g., A=4.0, A-=3.7, B+=3.3, etc. - this mapping should be configurable or based on a standard scale).

## Viral/Shareable Features

- Implement a "Share My Semester GPA" feature allowing students to share their calculated semester GPA (or potential scenarios) via social media with customizable, visually appealing cards.
- Create subtle animations or visual feedback when the calculated GPA changes.

## UI/UX Approach

- Maintain the clean, distraction-free interface established in other calculators.
- Use the existing ShadCN UI component library for consistency.
- Implement responsive design that works well on mobile devices.
- Provide clear visual feedback on the calculated semester GPA.
- Allow dynamic addition and removal of courses.
- Include a simple way to select/input grades and specify credit hours. Consider a dropdown for standard letter grades and a number input for credits.

## Implementation Requirements

### Page Structure

1. Header with page title ("Semester GPA Calculator") and brief explanation.
2. Calculator card area for adding/managing courses.
    - Input fields for Course Name (optional), Grade, and Credit Hours.
    - Buttons to add more courses or remove existing ones.
    - Display or link to the grade-to-GPA point mapping being used.
3. Results display showing the calculated Semester GPA prominently.
4. Optional: Display total credit hours calculated.

### Technical Considerations

- Implement using the existing React component patterns.
- Manage the state of multiple courses (name, grade, credits) effectively, using `useState` with an array of objects.
- Implement the logic for converting various grade inputs (letter, percentage) into standard GPA points (e.g., 4.0 scale).
- Calculate the semester GPA using the formula: `Sum(Grade Points * Credit Hours) / Sum(Credit Hours)`.
- Ensure proper form validation (e.g., valid grade inputs, positive credit hours).
- Handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., invalid grade format).

### Integration Points

- Use the existing CalculationContext pattern if applicable, or establish a new context if more appropriate.
- Follow the established route structure.
- Potentially add a site-wide configuration for the Grade <-> GPA point mapping if it needs to be consistent or user-adjustable across the site.

## Essence of Simplicity

- Primary focus on the intuitive input of courses, grades, and credit hours, and the clear display of the semester GPA.
- Every UI element should directly support the GPA calculation process.
- Adding/removing/editing courses should be straightforward.
- The "what-if" aspect should be implicitly supported by allowing easy grade/credit modification.

### Non-goals:

- No need to allow users to save calculations.
- Does not calculate cumulative GPA (only the GPA for the entered semester).
- Does not need to store course information beyond the current session.

## SEO Implementation

- Implement the following JSON-LD structured data for rich search results:
