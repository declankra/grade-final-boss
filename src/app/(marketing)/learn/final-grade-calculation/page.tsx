        <h1>How to Calculate Your Final Grade: Essential Guide</h1>
        <p>
          Wondering what grade you need on your final exam or project to achieve a specific overall course grade? Calculating your potential final grade helps manage expectations and focus your study efforts effectively.
        </p>

        <h2>Understanding Weighted Grades</h2>
        <p>
          Most courses weigh different assignments differently. For example, homework might be 20% of your grade, midterms 30%, and the final exam 50%. Knowing these weights is crucial for accurately calculating your current standing and predicting your final grade.
        </p>

        <h2>Steps to Calculate Your Needed Final Grade</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Determine your desired overall course grade:</strong> What percentage or letter grade are you aiming for (e.g., 90% for an A)?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Find the weights of each grade category:</strong> Check your syllabus (e.g., Homework 20%, Quizzes 15%, Midterm 30%, Final Exam 35%).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Calculate your current grade:</strong> Determine your average score in each completed category and multiply by its weight. Sum these results to find your current percentage in the course.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Calculate the required final exam score:</strong>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
              <li>Subtract your current weighted score (from step 3) from your desired overall grade (from step 1).</li>
              <li>Divide this result by the weight of the final exam (as a decimal).</li>
              <li>The result is the percentage score you need on the final exam.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>Formula Example:</strong> Needed Final Score = [Desired Grade (%) - Current Grade Weighted Score (%)] / Final Exam Weight (%)
